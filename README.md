# Planner App

This is my overambitious planner app that I hope to build over the course of the next few months. the goal is to create something I can use it in everyday life and will also teach me how
to better use different technologies. ~~Currently it is using git, webpack, npm and nodeJs.~~

Currently it is using git, vite, React, Typescript, TailwindCSS and Firebase.
